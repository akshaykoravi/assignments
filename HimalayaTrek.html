					Trekking Shoes
				</h1>
				
				<p class="text-small">
					<br>Your choice of trekking boots will depend on 4 criteria: the terrain on which they will be used,the duration of the outing, the weather forecast and the support.<br>

					<br>TYPE OF TREK<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Easy Treks  - For shorter duration treks when you’re walking on vehicle-going roads, your shoe will require built-in cushioning, a crosscontact sole with good grip and traction incase of wet hard ground, 
							ankle support and a soft sole to ease the motion of the foot, ideal for easy treks</li><br>
						<li>Expedition Treks  - Expeditions require boots with highly durable materials and assemblies. Preferably a Vibram sole for better grip and traction on hard and wet ground, a rigid sole to favour foothold in 
							rugged areas and for cushioning, go for a EVA midsole with lower density pad under the heel</li>
					  </ul>
